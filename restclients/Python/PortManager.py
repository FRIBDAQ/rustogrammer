# @class PortManager
#
#    This class provides an interface to a port manager running on a specified
#    system.  Port managers allow you to:
#    *  Allocate ports for use as server listener ports from a pool of managed ports.
#    *  Determine which services have allocated which ports.
#
# @note Naturally you can only allocate a port from the local port manager.
#       The port manager itself enforces that restriction
class PortManager:
    ##
    # _init__
    #   Constructor for the object.  A connection is made to the specified
    #   port manager.   The connection is maintained until the object is destroyed.
    #   note that if you allocate a port you must maintain the connection to the
    #   port manager while you use that port as the drop of that connection
    #   is what releases the port.
    #
    # @param host - Host name/IP of the port manager.
    # @param port - The port on which the port manager itself is listening
    #               for connections.  By default this is 30000 but this can
    #               be overidden in non-standard configurations.
    # @throw various from socket and connect.

        self.socket = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)
        self.socket.connect((host, port))

    ##
    # getPort
    #   Given a service name returns a port from the connected port manager.
    #   On error, a RuntimError is raised, that is the error message
    #   from the server.
    #
    # @param service - The service we want to advertise.
    #
    # @return integer - The port that has been allocated.

    # @throw other        - From socket operations.

        #  In the second case, the connection to the server is closed and
        #  *  All ports we have acquired are released.
