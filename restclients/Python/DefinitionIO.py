''' 
This module provides code to save/restore various definitions to an Sqlite3 database file.
One would create one of a DefinitionWriter or DefinitionReader object and then invoke the various
methods  on that to do the I/O.  The database files use the same schema as the SpecTcl
sqlite3 data store; See https://docs.nscl.msu.edu/daq/newsite/spectcldb/index.html

Note that while that schema supports storing more than one 'save set' in a single database file,
this capability is not used and when a database file is initialized, the save set created is 
called 'rustogramer_gui'.

       database file can result in undefined consequences.

       e.g. runs and spectrum contents, we don't create those elements.

        '''
        Reads all condition definitions from file's open saveset and returns them as a 
        list of dicts.  Each dict will have the following keys:
          name - The name of the condition type.
          type - The type string of the condition type.
          points - list of (x,y) pairs that are the condition points for conditions that have points
                 This can be empty.
          parameters - List of parameters that are used by the condition
          dependencies - List of condition names this condition depends on.
          mask   - If the condition is a mask the value of this mask.
          
          Note that conditions are guaranteed to be in an order such that iterating over
          the list allows the conditions to be defined (e.g. dependent conditions before
          conditions that depend on them).   This is a natural consequence of the fact
          that the writer writes them in that order and, by ordering by primary key,
          we get them out of the database in that order.
          
          Unfortunately, the variability of condition definitions does not really allow us to make
          much use of fancy queries to reduce the number of queries needed to reconstruct
          a condition.  We are able to do the usual fancy things to turn ids into names
          for the parameters and dependent conditions.
