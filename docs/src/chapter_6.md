# Chapter 6 - the REST interface

Rustogramer has no interactive interface baked into it.  It *does* provide a REST-like interface/API to which user interface programs can use.  There are two language bindings to this interface:

*  [Tcl](./chap6_1.md) which you can use to create/port GUIs using Tcl/Tk
*  [Python](./chap6_2.md)  which also includes a sample fully featured [GUI](./chapter_4.md)

To be clear, these are client side APIs.  If you are interested in contributing a binding for another language, [here is documentation for tha requests and responses](./chap7_2.md)
