# Looking at the Rustogramer internals documentation

Rust projects carry the ability to produce internals documentation from declarations and documentation comments using ```cargo doc```

In a normal installation of rustogramer internals documentation are produced and installed.  Suppose rustogramer is installed in some directory path called *target* internals are available via a web browser at:

* Windows: file:///C:/*target*/docs/internal/rustogrammer/index.html
* Unix like installations:  file:///*target*/share/docs/internal/rustogrammer/index.html

Note that the doubled m's in ```rustogrammer``` in the links above are not typographical errors.

Furthermore, this documentation is also installed at:

* windows: file:///C:/*target*/docs/user/index.html
* Unix like installations:  file:///*target*/share/docs/user/index.html
