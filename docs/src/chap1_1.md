## How to use this book

How you use this book depends on how you are going to use
Rustogramer.  

*  If you need to create data sets that Rustogramer can use you need to read <tt>Insert link to preparing data here</tt>.
*  If you are going to use Rustogramer to analyze existing data sets, you'll need to look at:
    * <tt>Link to running rustogramer</tt>
    * <tt>Link to interacting with rustogramer via GUI here
    *  </tt> and link to <tt>CutiePie here</tt>.
    * <tt>Link to command line options referenc here</tt>
*  If you want to write, or modify rustogramer GUIs you'll want to look at:
    * Tcl clients:  <tt>Rest interfaces for Tcl</tt>
    * Python clients: <tt>Rest interfaces for Python</tt>
    * Some other language: <tt>REST Requests/responses</tt>

If Rustogramer is *not* installed on your system, you or your system manager, depending on your environment will need to look at <tt>Installing </tt>

If you're interested in how Rutogramer works, or are interested in contributing to it in some way, you'll need to 
know <tt>How to look at the rustogramer internals.</tt>
