
//!  This module is in charge of maintaining the contents
//!  of spectrum bindings in an Xamine compatible shared memory
//!  region.
//!  We include:
//!  *  A thread that accepts and processes requests from clients
//! (Usually REST handlers)
//!  *  An API for properlty formatting requests and relaying
//! return values to the caller.
//!
//!  See BindingThread for more information about how bound spectra
//!  work.
